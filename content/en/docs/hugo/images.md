  How to add, work with, and process images.

## Project location

You can store images in one of the following locations, depending on the use case:
- page bundle: If an image is used in a branch or leaf bundle, include the image in the bundle.
- `/assets`: Require further processing with Hugo Pipes. Ideally, most of our images are in this directory and processed for optimization.
- `/static`: Used as-is with no further processing.
