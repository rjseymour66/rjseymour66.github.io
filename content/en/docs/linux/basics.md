## Set default text editor

Ubuntu uses `nano` by default, change it to `vim`:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config editor
There are 4 choices for the alternative editor (providing /usr/bin/editor).

  Selection    Path                Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
  0            /bin/nano            40        auto mode
  1            /bin/ed             -100       manual mode
  2            /bin/nano            40        manual mode
* 3            /usr/bin/vim.basic   30        manual mode
  4            /usr/bin/vim.tiny    15        manual mode

## Change hostname

```bash
hostnamectl set-hostname mylittlecloudbox
```

## Set timezone

This is important for scheduling tasks and the timestamps for logs under `/var/log`:

```bash
# view current timezone
timedatectl
               Local time: Sun 2024-12-01 17:15:21 UTC
           Universal time: Sun 2024-12-01 17:15:21 UTC
                 RTC time: Sun 2024-12-01 17:15:21
                Time zone: Etc/UTC (UTC, +0000)             # current tz
System clock synchronized: yes
              NTP service: active
          RTC in local TZ: no

# get list of available timezones
timedatectl list-timezones

# set new timezone
sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York

# verify
timedatectl
               Local time: Sun 2024-12-01 12:15:57 EST
           Universal time: Sun 2024-12-01 17:15:57 UTC
                 RTC time: Sun 2024-12-01 17:15:57
                Time zone: America/New_York (EST, -0500)
System clock synchronized: yes
              NTP service: active
          RTC in local TZ: no

HIER(7)                                       Linux Programmer's Manual                                       HIER(7)

NAME
       hier - description of the filesystem hierarchy

DESCRIPTION
       A typical Linux system has, among others, the following directories:

       /      This is the root directory.  This is where the whole tree starts.

       /bin   This  directory contains executable programs which are needed in single user mode and to bring the sys‚Äê
              tem up or repair it.
       ...
```

### ls

```bash
ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
ll # list long
-a # all files, incl hidden
-d # current dir own metadata
-F # classify 
-h # human readable byte size
-i # inodes
-l # long (all metadata)

ls -ltra
```

### pushd and popd

Tracks your directory history. `pushd` puts your dir in a stack, and `popd` pops it off so you can retrace your steps:

```bash
~$ pushd /var/log
/var/log ~

/var/log$ pushd /dev/
/dev /var/log ~

/dev$ pushd /etc/
/etc /dev /var/log ~

/etc$ popd
/dev /var/log ~

/dev$ popd
/var/log ~

/var/log$ popd
~

~$ 

```
### popd

```bash

```
