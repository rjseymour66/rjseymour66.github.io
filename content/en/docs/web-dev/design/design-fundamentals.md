Layout is the most important part of web design. These practices help build a strong foundation for your website design:
- Proximity
- Alignment
- Repetition
- Contrast
- Balance and Symmetry

## Proximity

This is all about relationships. The closer elements are to one another, the more we see them as a group:
- this is the primary method of organizing objects in design
- whitespace is how you group and create distinction for users
- Keep unrelated items apart

### Proximity prevents confusion
- Creates easily scannable web pages
- The goal is to create easily identifiable sections of content for users
- Reduces cognitive load - how much your user needs to think about how to interact with the page
- For page layouts, add less margin between related block elements to distinguish them from each other

During wireframing, focus first on proximity: grouping and organizing components on the page to make sure the relationships make sense.

### Forms need proximity
Proximity provides a natural stopping point if the user needs to return later

## Alignment

Alignment establishes order on the page and creates relationships. In web design, alignment is the following:
- positioning elements along different axes
- aligning groups of elements to form a cohesive unit
- text alignment (justified, centered, etc)

### Types of alignment

There are two ways to align elements:
- edge alignment: elements are aligned along a composition's top, bottom, left, or right edges
- center alignment: elements are horizontally (horizontal axis) or vertically (vertical axis) aligned down a central axis

Text alignment is a little different but with similar goals:
- helps establish order and clear hierarchy
- left, right, center, justified
- justified adds spacing between words so that the left and right edges are even. can impact readability

> For cards, if you align the top and bottom edges, the middle content doesn't need to be aligned.

### Establishing order

Establish a strong line and use that to align elements on the page. You can choose different alignments for different sections on the page:
- mixing alignments between sections distinguishes sections and creates dynamic content, which keeps the user engaged by moving their eyes through the content

## Repitition
