Typeface sets the tone for the entire user experience.

## Basics

A typeface is a set of characters, and a font is a variation of that typeface in weight, size, etc. There are four categories of typefaces:
- serif: have small lines (serifs) at the end of larger strokes.
  - Professional, strict impression
- sans serif: sans = "without"--it comes from French. Have the same line thickness throughout the letter, can be hard to distinguish in big blocks of text and on smaller screens.
  - Modern, trendy, clean impression
- script: based on calligraphy and handwriting. Popular for wedding decorations. Good for headlines and titles. Don't use for body copy. Keep as large as possible for short lines of text.
  - Blogs, very informal
- decorative: Have ornaments, embellishments, or other treatments that make them unique. Use sparingly for headlines or section headings. DO NOT use for body text.


### Styles and weights

Italic and oblique:
- italics are slanted but seem more like cursive
  - `<em>`: when you want to add emphasis
  - `<i>`: distinguish text to create a mood for idiomatic, technical, or taxonmy
- oblique are normal typefaces but at a slant

### Weights

Create contrast in your typography and draw attention:
- all typefaces have at least normal and bold weights
- Use lighter font size for large text because lighter is hard to read on small text
  - `<b>`: draw attention to words
  - `<strong>`: these words have greater importance than the rest of the text

### Use 3 fonts
- body copy
- large headings
- smaller headings and text that needs to stand out
- **You can use one typeface, or one for body copy, and one for anything that isn't body copy**.

## Picking a font

Consider the following when selecting fonts:
- It should be readable and legible at the size you intend to use
- DO NOT use decorative fonts for long body copy. Use sans serif or serif
- Start with Google Fonts, then FontSquirrel. Google Fonts are free and optimized for the web

### Pairing typefaces and fonts

Create a cohesive set of typography that helps define the hierarchy of your page and draws readers' eyes:
- use different fonts of the same typeface family, like Roboto and Roboto Slab
- use different fonts of the same typeface by mixing and matching font weights

You can pair different typeface categories, like script and serif, serif and sans-serif, etc.

### Type ramp

A type ramp is a set of guidelines and font styles tht define the family, size, style, when and where fonts are used in your site:
- its your type strategy
- similar pages should share styles

Start here when defining your type ramp:
- Heading `<h1>`
- Subheading `<h2>`
- Title `<h3>`
- Subtitle `<h4>`
- Body `<p>`
- Caption `<caption>`

### Size selection

Body font should be defined as 1rem, with a base size between 16px and 18px. Then, create your type scale:
- Body: 1rem
- Subtitle: 1.5rem
- Title: 2rem
- Subheading: 2.5rem
- Heading: 3rem
