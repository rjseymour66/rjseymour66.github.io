User experience is the interaction someone has with your product and how that interaction makes them feel about your product.

These are the parts of the UX Honeycomb, which represents the different aspects of a product that are required to creaet a meaningful and valuable experience:
- Useful: Does it fulfill a need and do so successfully?
- Usable: Is it easy to use?
- Findable: Is it easy to find things and navigate through the site?
- Valuable: Does the site bring value? Does it create profit or fulfill a mission?
- Desirable: Is it well-designed? Does it use branding, imagery, and other elements to create a visually pleasing experience?
- Credible: Can users trust the content and source?
- Accessible: Is it accessible to users with disabilities who use assistive technology?

## UX design

This usually focuses on visual design, which can be broken down into the following areas:
- research: The foundation of any project. You ID the target audience to understand their needs and behavior.
- design: WHere the site planning, layout, and visual design start to take shape--wireframing, IA, UI design, static visual design, interactive prototypes
- prototyping
- testing
- measurement

## UX writer

Research and develop user personas to craft copy for all pieces of the user interface that customers come in contact with.
- sometimes called "microcopy"

## UX methodologies

Frameworks to complete work. They are flexible and do not have to be followed completely. The most common are _user-centered design_ and _double diamond process_.

### User-centered design

Every stage of the project focuses on the user. There are four general phases:
- Specify the context of use: ID the primary target audience, why they use the product, their requirements, the context that they will use it
- Specify requriements: What business reqs or user goals need to be achieved?
- Create design solutions: create wireframes, visual mockups, prototyping, and begin development
- Evaluate designs: test designs and prototypes with actual users

### Double diamond process

Combination of divergent thinking (exploring a problem widely) and convergent thinking (taking focused action). This centers more on creating designs rather than users, while keeping users in mind throughout the process.

You can break this down into four phases:
- Discover: Research to gather data
- Define: Filter the research to focus on the problem you are solving
- Develop: Explore multiple solutions
- Deliver: Hone solutions to the most successful one, and deliver it

## User research

User research provides data to make informed decisions and ensure you're building the right solution for your end users:
- Initial data gathering: Concretely define your target audience and figure out what they ened and want. Conduct individual interviews, run focus groups, hand out surveys.
  
  If you are building a completely new product, focus on your competitors.
- User personas: A realistic but fictional description of someone that is in your target audience. This helps to build empathy for the target users.
- User needs: Also called "problem statements", they determine what problem the app solves. Larger projects have more than one user need that form a hierarchy of needs. Always interview potential users, if possible. Otherwise, your user needs are nothing more than a hypothesis.
  
  Here is a description:

  _A user need statement is an actionable problem statement used to summarize who a particular ser is, the user's need, and why the need is important to that user. It defines what you want to solve before you move on to generating potential solutions, in order to 1) condense your perspective on the problem, and 2) provide a metric to be used throughout the design thinking process._

- Define site objectives: Align user goals with business goals. For example:
  - business goal: Increase sales by 10%
  - user goal: find an item and determine if it is available, its size, and price
  - user goal: purchase the item
  
  You could develop a standard product page that also recommends related items to the user to increase sales.
- Create S.M.A.R.T. goals: They ensure your user goals are reachable and effective so you can track progress and improvement. Don't create vague goals. You should "increase sales by 10%", not "increase sales."
  - **S**pecific
  - **M**easurable
  - **A**ssignable
  - **R**ealistic
  - **T**ime-related (set a deadline)
  
  Another version:
  - Specific: What is the user trying to accomplish
  - Measurable: What can we measure to ensure users are successful
  - Actionable: Need to create and execute specific design and development tasks to reach the goal
  - Relevant: Ensure that the features we add to the page meet user needs and don't make completing their task too difficult.
  - Trackable: Track the success or failure of designs over a specific amount of time
  

### Strategies

There are lots of strategies, so we will examine them in terms of qualitative vs quantitative, and attitude and behavior.

#### Qualitative and quantitative

Qualitative is free-form data--it's words. Gather qualitative data through interviews, focus groups, observations, etc. Quantitative is hard data--numbers--that is gathered from analytic tools and surveys and it validates what the users said they wanted in our qualitative data.

#### User attitude vs user behavior

Attitude is how users feel about something--their opinions and judgements.

Behavior is what the users actually do.

### Methods

#### Card sorting

Asks users to group content and pages the way they would naturally expect it. Helps establish the organization of the website's content and navigation. Write out main content types on cards.

- Open card sort asks users to group content then provide a name for the content group. Use the label as the nav menue text
- Closed card sort asks users to group content into pre-defined categories

#### Competitive analysis

Identify three to five competitors and make notes about what they do well in these areas:
- Visual design
- Content
- User flows to perform similar tasks
- Functionality
- Navigation
- Usability
- Tone

#### Focus groups

Qualitative research with a group of 5 to 10 people. Ask specific questions and provide discussion topics to control the conversation.
- participants should understand the topic
- should be prospective users
- record the session to ensure accurate notes
- ask open-ended questions

#### Interviews

One-on-one sessions with a prospective user:
- Ask open-ended questions
- interview a minimum of 10 people
- define a specific goal to achieve with the interview

#### Surveys

Mix of qualitative and quantitative data, very easy and cheap to conduct:
- give people the chance to elaborate
- keep it short
- don't ask leading questions

#### Usability testing

Task-based method where you watch people use your product:
- can use clickable wireframes or mock-ups
- record sessions if you can
- can be costly

#### Informal methods

Look online:
- Check social media
- conduct polls on social media

## UX design

You have to build out the entire visual experience before you move on to the dev phase:
- Designing the visual look and feel of the UI
- Wireframing and IA to build the site's scaffolding
- Design interaction and user flows

### Information architecture

IA is about preventing your users from feeling lost:
- structuring and organizing data and content and labeling it:
- establising relationships between the different pages and content
- informs the navigation and content strategy of the site
- orients the user and lets them know what they might expect next

This step is about documenting the website structure and types of content on each page so you know that user needs are met.

#### Site mapping

A map of your websites structure and content:
- some form of a chart that shows the hierarchy and relationships between the pages of content
- breakdown of all major landing pages and subpages and how they are linked
- high-level overview--focus is how you get to the content, not the details
  - help create _journey maps_
- maybe a diagram or a spreadsheet
- You can include the sitemap in the footer too

Search engines use XML sitemaps:
- find a tool to generate the file
- helps search engines with SEO

#### Site navigation and wayfinding

Sitemap and content inventory should inform the main navigation menu on your website:
- include breadcrumbs so users can see how they got where they are and find their way back

#### Content inventory and audit

When you work on reorg'ing an existing project, you might take an inventory and dump it into a spreadsheet. New websites can benefit from the spreadsheet too. Include the following (pg 96):
- Page the content lives on
- Page metadata
- Title of content or summary of what the piece of content is
- Author
- URL
- File format (image, article, UI, etc)
- Description of content
- Date content was created

A content audit determines whether the content should be thrown away, rewritten, or kept as is. Ask these questions:
- Is the content meeting its goals?
- does it provide value?
- is it meeting user goals?
- is it meeting buisness goals?
- does it match the voice and tone of the brand?
- is it getting views/attention?

These questions help develop a road map and align with user and business needs.

### User flows and journeys

After you have a sitemap and define your IA, you can create your user flows and user journeys:

#### User flows

User flows focus on providing clarity about each step in the process that completes a task:
- routes users take to complete a task on your app
- includes the entrypoint and every step until the user completes their goal
- can be a flow chart with labels for each interaction, or detailed wireframe
- helps ID points in user experience that you can optimize
- 


#### User journey

User journey maps create a narrative from a user persona's point of view:
- maps out the experience of your main user persona and ties in an emotional element to identify what your user is thinking and feeling at each stage in their journey with your product
- steps can occur in digital or physical world

Steps to create a user journey (pg 99):
1. Define the target user persona
2. Decide the scenario or scope of the user journey. Who is this user, and what are they trying to achieve? What are their expectations?
3. Map the scenario steps to what the user may be thinking, doing, or feeling when completing the step
4. Identify opportunities for improvement

Consider creating a user journey for a person that is stressed:
- these people probably aren't thinking clearly, so you'll want to reduce the number of barriers for them

### Designing your site and application

After you plan the content, start building in this general order:
1. Wireframes
2. Static visual design
3. Interaction design

#### Wireframes

These are the initial outline where you explore the layout:
- don't worry about color or type
- establish relationships between the content on the different pages and create a blueprint for expected functionality

There are wireframing levels:
- low-fidelity wireframes are very rough drafts that are sketches of what it could look like
- medium-fidelity wireframes are created with a tool like figma, balsamiq, or axure RP. These provide good accuracy without being pixel-specific
  - Might include type weights, greyscale, and other basic graphic decisions
  - Use lorem ipsum
- high-fidelity wireframes are detailed and pixel-specific
  - don't use color except on CTAs or important things. It will distract
  - try to use real text, not placeholder

#### UI design and full-color mockups

UI design is the visual and interactive elements of the website:
- when people land on your website, they see the colors, space, type, etc, and form a first impression that determines whether they continue on your site

#### Prototyping

This tests the usability of your design:
- low-fidelity prototypes: create these with pen and paper for a walkthrough with your user
- high-fidelity prototypes: have some level of interactivity with clickable components
  - you want users to ask questions when showing them this prototype

Prototyping is iterative research, so test often and repeat.
