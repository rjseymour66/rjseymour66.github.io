Javascript was created to enable dynamic behavior in the documents displayed by web browsers:
- A browser is like an OS - they provide a platform for application development and a variety of services like networking, storage, threading, etc.
- "Client-side" Javascript is code written to run in the browser
- The JS Web APIs are defined by consensus among browser vendors, and it is written in C++. 
- There are no "official" JS docs - [Mozilla Development Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is the most authoritative source.
