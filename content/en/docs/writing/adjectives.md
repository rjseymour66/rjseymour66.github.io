Adjectives describe nouns.

## Basic types

Attributive adjectives come before nouns:
- a _silly_ idea
- eight _red_ cars

Predicate adjectives are in the predicate and linked to the subject by a linking verb:
- Her patience is _thin_.
- My dog is _deaf_. 

## Comparatives

Adjectives that have an _-er_ form are called _comparatives_:
- taller
- faster
- lighter
- smaller

If the adjective does not have an _-er_ form, you can make it a comparative by preceding it with _more_:
- more interesting
- more professional
- more beautiful

## Superlatives

Adjectives that have an _-est_ form are called _superlatives_:
- tallest
- fastest
- lightest
- smallest

If the adjective does not have an _-est_ form, you can make it a comparative by preceding it with _most_:
- most interesting
- most professional
- most beautiful

## Nominal adjectives

Adjectives that are used as nouns because they so clearly and directly represent the people or things that they describe:
- the poor
- the elderly
