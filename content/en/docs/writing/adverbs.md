An adverb is a word that modifies a whole clause or answers the following questions:
- When?
- Where?
- In what manner?
- To what degree?
- How frequently?

Manner adverbs describe actions and end in _-ly_:
- It was _greatly_ exaggerated.

| Question | Example |
|---|---|
| When? | I saw him _yesterday_. |
| Where? | Rick is _inside_. |
| In what manner? | The day came together _beautifully_. |
| To what degree? | The glass was _very_ cold. |
| Modify whole clause* | _Luckily_, we hit a green light. |
| Modify whole clause* | _Futhermore_, we concluded that no action was necessary. |

The last two examples are sentence adverbs bc they modify the entire sentence. Within sentence adverbs are _conjunctive_ adverbs that join clauses while adding information like the logical connection between ideas:
- furthermore
- therefore

## vs Adverbials

Adverbials are not necessarily classified as an adverb, but they function as adverbs:
- I'll see you _Wednesday_.

_Wednesday_ is a noun, but it functions as one in the previous sentence: it answers the question "When?".

### Prepositional phrases as adverbials

Entire prepositional phrases can function as an adverb:
- Do not wear your shoes _in the rain_.
- Leave your car _in the yard_.

## Postmodifiers, premodifiers, & adverbials

| Function | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Postmodifier | Comes after the word it modifies. | June came _slowly_. |
| Premodifier | Precedes the word it modifies. | John happily said "yes". |
| Adverbial | Add information about when, where, and degree to the whole clause. | Do it _now_. |

Adjuncts
: Integral to the sentence, you cannot just remove them or the sentece does not make sense:
  
  Put it _here_.

Conjuncts
: Optional modifiers of whole clauses or sentences that create logical connections between thoughts:
  - however
  - therefore
  - consequently
  - nevertheless
  - additionally
  - in addition to

Disjuncts
: Essentially sentence adverbs that do not logically link clauses together, but provide overview information such as commentation to the whole clause or sentence:
  - _Honestly_, I am not sure how you do it.
  - _Frankly_, you are annoying me.
  - _To be honest_, I am not sure how you do it.
  - _To be frank_, you are annoying me.
