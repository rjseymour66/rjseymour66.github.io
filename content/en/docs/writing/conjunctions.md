Conjunctions join words, phrases, and clauses.

## Coordinating conjunctions

Connect units of equal grammatical status, which means you can change their order without changing their meaning. The most common ones spell out FANBOYS:
- for
- and
- nor
- but
- or
- yet
- so

Other properties:
- Some of these words are other parts of speech. Pay attention to when they act as joiners
- often work with commas
- 

### Coordinate noun phrase

These can do the same job as an individual noun, including being an object:
- _Sara and I_ are going jogging.
- You should come dancing with _Jerry and me_.

They can also be compound subjects and objects:
- The _dog and cat_ drank out of the puddle.

The verb type is determined by the conjunction:
- Either Bill or Ted _is_ coming. (singular)
- Jack and Jill _are_ here. (plural)
- A coach or players are coming to the park. (closest to the verb dictates which verb)

## Subordinate conjunction

Subordinate conjunctions link whole clauses that indicates a relationship between them and render one of the clauses dependent on the other. Some common examples:
- because
- until
- than
- although
- while
- after
- if 
- when
- since
- unless
- why
- before
- whether
- once
- where
- even if
- in order that
- rather than

If a clause can stand on its own, its an _independent clause_. If you join them with a coordinating conjunction, they are coordinate clauses:
- The campers were gone, and the bear ate the honey.

A subordinating conjunction makes one clause dependent (subordinate) on the other one, because it means that one clause needs the other to form a complete sentence:
- [_Because_ the campers were gone], the bear ate the honey. [subordinate clause]

## Correlative conjunctions

These conjunctions work in pairs:
- both...and
- either...or
- neither...nor
- not...but
- not only...but also
- whether...or

Each part of the conjunction introduces a clause, phrase, or word that are similar in length:
- It took _not_ one _but_ two attempts.
- _Whether_ we do _or_ we don't, we will probably be OK.
- I believe that _both_ the Yankees _and_ the Red Sox will hit a home run.
