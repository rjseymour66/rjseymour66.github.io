You can coordinate noun phrases and clauses with coordinating conjunctions:
- _Salt and vinegar_ taste good on chips. (noun phrases)
- _I can go to the game_ or _I can go to the concert_.

## Verb phrases

When a single noun is the subject of multiple verbs:
- I _ate_ the burger and _drank_ the soda.
- Sally was _singing_, _laughing_, and _skipping_ all the way to the show.

## Commas and adjectives

To figure out whether they are coordinate, check the following:
- Replace the comma with _and_
- Move the adjectives around

Commas go between coordinate adjectives but they do not go between noncoordinate adjectives.

Coordinate adjectives are joined with implied coordinating conjunctions. The commas represent the conjunction:
- Sara is reading my _boring_, _nerdy_, _time-consuming_ writing notes.
