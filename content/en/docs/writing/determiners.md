Determiners introduce noun phrases and convey information like quantity and definiteness:
- I want some pie.

If the word doesn't introduce a noun phrase, it is a pronoun:
- I want some.

## Definite and indefinite articles

_The_ is the only definite article. It refers to a specific thing or things:
- The woman next door.
- The jokes were funny.

Use _an_ based on sound, not spelling:
- A university.
- An FBI agent.
