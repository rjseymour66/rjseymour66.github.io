## Independent clauses

Contain a subject and a conjugated verb that form the core of the sentence:
- stands alone
- can be coordinated with one or more clauses, joined by a coordinating conjunction
- works with subordinate clauses 

## Subordinate clauses

Called dependent clause because they cannot stand alone.

## Form

### Finite

"Finite" describes how the verb works--it has a subject and shows tense. Contain a subject and a conjugated verb. Can be main or subordinate:
- Sparks flew.
- I knew there would be trouble when sparks flew. (subordinate)

### Nonfinite

Nonfinite clauses have a verb that does not show tense--it is not conjugated to work with a tense. This includes:
- infinitives (to _verb_)
- _-ed_ verbs
- _-ing_ verbs

#### Examples

- To bake a cookie, form a ball of dough on a plate.
- When baking cookies, keep your eye on the clock.
- Baked in the morning, these cookies will be great later this evening.

### Verbless

Leave the whole verb or part of the verb implied. Usually the verb is a form of be (is, are, etc.):

- If necessary, you can stay at my place this evening. (implied _it is_)
- When annoyed, the teacher assigns extra homework. (implied _she is_)

## Function

### Nominal clauses

Noun clauses. When a clause functions like a noun:
- subject of the verb
- objects of transitive verbs
- object of preposition

The clause is usually subordintaed with a word like:
- how
- that
- what
- whatever
- when
- where
- whether
- which
- whichever
- who
- whoever
- whom
- whomever
- why

Examples:
- _Whatever you want_ is fine with me.
- _Whether you leave before 9am_ determines the traffic.
- Please just pick _whichever drink you want_.
- The game is _whatever you make of it_.

### Adjective clauses (relative clauses)

Modifies a noun that immediately precedes it, and introduced with a relative pronoun, which is sometimes implied:
- that
- which
- who
- whom

The relative pronoun can introduce a noun that's the subject of the verb in the clause, or it can be the subject:
- There's no way _that_ she leaves the house.
- I have a new favorite song, _which_ is slower than the last.
- There's no way she leaves now. (implied _that_)

#### Sentential relative clause

These clauses modify a whole clause:
- He took all the leftovers, _which is out of character for him_.

### Adverbial clause

Typically subordinate clauses that describe a verb, or add extra information to the sentence:
- place
- time
- condition
- circumstance
- concession (although, though, while): Bridge an incongruity between the main clause and subordinate adverbial clause.
- reason (because, since, therefore, other conjunctions)
- cause
- purpose
- result (so)
- manner (as)
- proportion (use comparative adjective _-er_)
- similarity (just as [x], [y])
- comment

#### Examples

| Expression | Example |
|---|---|
| Time | _When your leg is healed_, we will play basketball again. |
| Place | I will follow you _wherever you go_. |
| Circumstance | _If need be_, you should visit your mother. |
| Condition (usually subordinated with _if_) | _If you have a better idea_, then speak up. |
| Concession | _Although we were ready_, they caught us completely by surprise. |
| Reason | I am not sure _because I never read the book_. |
| Purpose | Move your car _so I can get out in the morning_. |
| Result | There was no traffic, _so we made great time_. |
| Manner | The dog barked _as if he never met me_. |
| Proportion | The sooner you stop talking, the _better the evening will be_. |
| Similarity | Just as he said he would, he paid for dinner. |
| Comment | _To be honest_, I couldn't care less. |

### Comparative clauses

They often use _than_ or _as [blank] as_ with a comparative adjective phrase like _smarter_ or _more thoughtful_:
- I can't believe I've known you _as long as I have_.
