A phrase is a unit that functions as a particular part of speech, such as a noun, verb, adjective, adverb, or preposition. A phrase can be a single word or it can contain other phrases.

## Noun phrases

Usually headed by nouns or pronouns, other words are called dependents because you can delete them without damaging the sentence syntax. They commonly act as the following:

| Function | Example | 
|---|---|
| subject  | _Steaks_ are the best food. |
| object of transitive verbs  | We will eat _steaks_.  |
| object of prepositions  | The buffet was different kinds _of steaks_.  |
| indirect object  | I gave _John_ a free taco. |
| subject predicative  | Jack is _the man_. |
| object predicative  | Everyone considers Bill Gates _a genius_. |
| premodifier of other nouns | the _shoe_ store |
| vocative (direct address/what you call someone)  | I hope you are doing well, _Josie_.  |
| appositive (restate with extra info)  | Vince, _a salesman_, always has an angle.  |

### Appositives

An appositive restates the noun and adds additional information. You can distinguish between the subject and appositive by looking at how commas set them apart:
- My favorite [song], _Layla_, is a classic. ([subject], _appositive_)
- _My favorite song_, [Layla] is a classic.

- _Old black cats_ are especially scary. (noun head)
- _We_ went to the store. (pronoun head)
- _Talking_ is her favorite activity. (gerund head)
- _The poor_ are never in luck. (nominal adj head)

### Premodifiers and postmodifiers

Premodifiers come before the noun that they modify:
- _red_ shirt
- _Italian_ wine

Postmodifiers come after the noun, and are usually participial modifying phrases and prepositional phrases:
- wine _from Italy_
- shirts _colored_ red

There can be a combination of the two:
- _Red_ wine _from Italy_ is my favorite.

### Restrictive modifiers

Restrictive modifers limit the scope of things referred to by the noun:
- Shoppers _who steal items_ are arrested.
- Credit card information _hacked off the internet_ is valuable.

Restrictive modifiers can omit _that_, the zero relative:
- Bread _that_ you bake is delicious.
- Bread you bake is delicious.

### Nonrestrictive modifiers

Nonrestrictive modifers do not limit the scope of things referred to by the noun. They are often separated from the noun phrase with commas, dashes, or parentheses:
- Shoppers (who steal items) are not welcome in the store.
- The song, which is a classic, has a great intro.

## Verb phrases

There are finite and nonfinite verb phrases:

finite
: Conjugated to work with a subject:
  Dan _drives_.

nonfinite
: Not inflected to work with the subject and form a clause. Often become participles, gerunds, and infinitives:
  - _Worrying_, I spent the night sitting on my bed.
  - _To train_, I lift weights three times a week.

### Composition

Can be used with auxiliaries, modal auxiliaries, or modifiers:
- Rick _stopped_ drinking.
- Rick _has stopped_ drinking.
- Rick _might stop_ drinking.

Adverb phrases can be in the middle:
- Rick _has [recently] stopped_ drinking.
- Rick _has [only recently] stopped_ drinking.

### Negation

We usually make the sentence negative with the verb phrase using a form of _be_ and _do_:
- I _am not_ here.
- She _does not_ want to leave.
- You _do not_ own a shovel.

## Adjective phrases

Perform the following jobs:
- premodify a noun
- serve as a subject predicative (reflects back on the sentence subject):
  - Kyle is _happy_.

### Coordinate and noncoordinate

Coordinate adjective phrases make sense with _and_, and each adjective modifies the noun equally:
- The food tasted _dry, flavorless, and salty_.

Noncoordinate phrases have adjectives that might be more important to the noun:
- The cheap _blue_ suit.

## Adverb phrases

Modify the entire sentence or answer the questions:
- In what manner?
- When?
- Where?
- To what degree?

They can be a single word or multiple words:
- He goes outside _very often_.
- Sara went to the dentist _early yesterday morning_.

### Types of adverbs

Adjunct
: Integral to the sentence:
  - I _only_ went because you told me to.

Conjunct
: Ties the sentence with a previous thought:
  - _Additionally_, I made sure the dogs were fed.

Disjunct
: Provides commentary on the entire sentence:
  - _Honestly_, this is the craziest rumor I've ever heard.

### Adverbials

Many adverb phrases that function as an adverbial (or adverbial phrase) have a preposition as their head word:
- Kevin drinks _like a fish_.

## Prepositional phrases

Take complements--items that complete them. These complements are usually one of the following:

| Phrase type | Example |
|---|---|
| noun phrases | I have to speak [with] _my mother_. |
| _-ing_ participle clauses | I am so tired [of] _arguing with my brother_. |
| _wh-_ clauses (who, what, where, ...) | Its a matter [of] _which route you take_. |
| _how_ clauses | ... |
| adverbs | [From] _where_ did you get the book? |
| adjectives | I finished the book [in] _solitude_.  |

They have several different functions:

| Function | Example |
|---|---|
| Modify noun | A person _in trouble_ should receive help. |
| Modify adjective | I'm miserable _in this heat_. |
| Subject predicative ( complement of copular verb) | The plane is _on standby_. |
| Object predicative | I stopped him _from leaving the party._ |
| Adverbial (modifies verb) | I [sang] the song _with gusto_. |


### Stranded preposition

When a preposition is not immediately followed by its complement because the complement came earlier or because it was omitted. This is when sentences are contorted to not end with a preposition:
- What are you waiting _for_? -> _For_ what are you waiting?

This happens for a few reasons:
- The sentence is passive: I can't talk _to_ him. -> He is someone I cannot talk _to_.
- The complement of the preposition is already made clear, often with "what" or "when" questions: What are you waiting _for_?
