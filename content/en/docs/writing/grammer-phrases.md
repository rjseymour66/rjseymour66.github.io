A phrase is a unit that functions as a particular part of speech, such as a noun, verb, adjective, adverb, or preposition. A phrase can be a single word or it can contain other phrases.

## Noun phrases

Usually headed by nouns or pronouns, other words are called dependents because you can delete them without damaging the sentence syntax. They commonly act as the following:

| Function | Example | 
|---|---|
| subject  | _Steaks_ are the best food. |
| object of transitive verbs  | We will eat _steaks_.  |
| object of prepositions  | The buffet was different kinds _of steaks_.  |
| indirect object  | I gave _John_ a free taco. |
| subject predicative  | Jack is _the man_. |
| object predicative  | Everyone considers Bill Gates _a genius_. |
| premodifier of other nouns | the _shoe_ store |
| vocative (direct address/what you call someone)  | I hope you are doing well, _Josie_.  |
| appositive (restate with extra info)  | Vince, _a salesman_, always has an angle.  |

### Appositives

An appositive restates the noun and adds additional information. You can distinguish between the subject and appositive by looking at how commas set them apart:
- My favorite [song], _Layla_, is a classic. ([subject], _appositive_)
- _My favorite song_, [Layla] is a classic.

- _Old black cats_ are especially scary. (noun head)
- _We_ went to the store. (pronoun head)
- _Talking_ is her favorite activity. (gerund head)
- _The poor_ are never in luck. (nominal adj head)

### Premodifiers and postmodifiers

Premodifiers come before the noun that they modify:
- _red_ shirt
- _Italian_ wine

Postmodifiers come after the noun, and are usually participial modifying phrases and prepositional phrases:
- wine _from Italy_
- shirts _colored_ red

There can be a combination of the two:
- _Red_ wine _from Italy_ is my favorite.

### Restrictive modifiers

Restrictive modifers limit the scope of things referred to by the noun:
- Shoppers _who steal items_ are arrested.
- Credit card information _hacked off the internet_ is valuable.

Restrictive modifiers can omit _that_, the zero relative:
- Bread _that_ you bake is delicious.
- Bread you bake is delicious.

### Nonrestrictive modifiers

Nonrestrictive modifers do not limit the scope of things referred to by the noun. They are often separated from the noun phrase with commas, dashes, or parentheses:
- Shoppers (who steal items) are not welcome in the store.
- The song, which is a classic, has a great intro.
