## Categories

### Number

Numbers related to nouns and pronouns:

- Singular: Refers to one thing.
- Plural: Refers to more than one thing.
- Noncount or mass: Refers to something measured in quantities.

Indefinite articles apply only to singular nouns:
- "_An_ ant", not "_An_ ants".

#### Plural

_Regular nouns_ are nouns that you can use a formula on and get its plural form:
- Nouns that end in a consonant that makes an "s-like" sound usually take an _es_.
  - boss_es_
  - fax_es_
- Words that end in y usually take an _ies_:
  - berr_ies_
  - ferr_ies_
- Proper nounds do not change form:
  - We're meeting the Nelsons.
  - There are two Ryans in this room.
- Words that end in _f_ or _fe_ often drop those letters and replace it with _ves_:
  - kni_ves_
  - lea_ves_

### Count vs noncount

Count nouns have a singular and plural form
- can be introduced with determiners (_these_, _few_, _many_, etc)
- likely to be quantifiable with expressions (pieces of pie, )

Noncount (mass) nouns don't have a singular and plural form:
- often refer to abstract things
- can be plural when you're using the name to refer to individual units like servings or varieties


### Gender

Gender only comes up when talking about pronouns.

### Case

There are three cases in English, which affect the pronoun more than the noun:

| Case | Description | Example | Pronoun | 
|---|---|---|---|
| subjective/nominative | Subject of a clause. | Rick asked for the remote control. | he |
| objective/accusative | Object of a verb or preposition. | The police chased Rick. | him |
| possessive/genitive | Shows possesion. | Rick's new dog is a terrier. | his |


### Possessive

| Type | Example |
|---|---|
| Singular | The dog's nose. |
| Plural regular | The houses' owner. |
| Irregular that doesn't end in 's' | The men's room. |
| Singular that ends in 's' | James's book.  |

#### Shared possessive

If the nouns share possession of the thing, they share just one apostrophy-plus-s:
- Steve and Joe's party. (Steve and Joe are throwing a party together--a single party.)

If the noun do not share possession, they each get their own apostrophy-plus-s:
- Steve's and Joe's parties. (Steve and Joe are each having their own party.)

#### Of-phrases for possession

Use when you want to put emphasis on the possessor instead of the thing possessed, bc the last word in a sentence or clause can have the biggest impact:

- "Howl of the wolf", emphasis on wolf. (The wolf's howl.)
- "Cry of the baby", emphasis on baby. (The baby's cry.)

Of-phrase possessives are not genitive. Often a poorer choice because it does not sound as natural.

#### Double genitive

When you use the apostrophe-plus-s and of-phrase possession:

- A friend of Valerie's.
- A friend of mine. (_mine_ is possessive)

Some say this is incorrect, but it is idiomatically correct.

#### Quasi possessives

When there isn't any clear possession:

- One weeks' pay.
- Get your money's worth.
- For goodness' sake.

Figures of speech, not logical constructions. They are expressions that have become possessives.

#### Possessive vs attributive

Attributive does not show possession--attributive nouns act as a an adjective:

- Farmer's market (market belonging to the farmer) vs farmers market (market of type farmer)

To determine whether you should use an apostrophe, reword the phrase with _for_ or an _of-phrase_:
- If there is an implied _for_. When you can reword the phrase with a _for_, then the apostrophe is often omitted:
  - retreat for couples = couples retreat
  - policy for homeowners = homeowners policy
- If you can reword with an _of-phrase_, then the apostrophe is often included:
  - questions of the students = student's questions
  - the vacation of the couples = the couples' vacation

### Proper vs common

Proper:
- Capitalize
- Does not usually change in its plural form
- When ending in _z_, _ch_, _x_, _sh_, and similar sounds, add _es_: The Cash_es_ are coming for dinner.

## Subcategories

### Collective

Nouns that clearly refer to more than one person, place, or thing:
- family
- team

There is no rule about how to make these plural.

### Attributive

Nouns that modify other nouns and can attribute qualities to another word in the same way that an adjective does:

- We went to the _shoe_ store.
- She called a _management_ meeting.

### Verbing of nouns

Come into existence when they are used enough:
- Hammer away.
- The first car dogged the second.
- Beer me.
