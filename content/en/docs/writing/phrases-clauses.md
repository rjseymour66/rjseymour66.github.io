## Phrases

In syntactical analysis, a phrase is a unit of one or more words doing the job (function) of a noun, verb, adjective, adverb, or preposition. Phrases can be a single word because a noun can function the same as a number of words. For example, "_The smelly cat_ meowed" and "_Cats_ meow".

Phrases can contain phrases. The function that we're analyzing--the noun, verb, adjective, etc--determines what we call the phrase (ex: noun phrase). We define the function by the head word we are looking for.

### Head word

Each phrase has a _head_ word. The head word is the word that defines the phrase and its job. It's the central word that determines the syntactic type and function of the phrase.

Less essential words are called _dependents_ because they rely on the head word of the phrase.

### Noun phrase

The noun phrase is a unit that has a noun or pronoun at its head:

- _The brown dog_ barked.
- _Dogs_ barked.

_The brown dog_ functions as a single unit.

Pronouns work the same as a noun because their syntactical function is identical:

- _It_ barked.
- _He_ barked.
- The cat chased _him_.

### Verb phrase

The verb phrase is a unit that has a verb at its head:

- The brown dog _barked_.

Verb phrases can be longer and more complicated:

- The brown dog _was barking_.
- The brown dog _was barking a lot_.
- The brown dog _had been barking very often_.

### Adjective phrase

The adjective phrase is a unit that has an adjective at its head:

- The _brown_ dog was barking.
- The _dark brown_ dog was barking.
- The _very dark brown_ dog was barking.
- The dog was _brown_.
- The dog was _chestnut brown_.

#### Attributive adjective

When the adjective is in front of the noun, its called an _attributive adjective_:
- The _brown_ dog was barking.
- The _dark brown_ dog was barking.

#### Predicate adjective

When the adjective comes after the noun, its called an _predicate adjective_:
- The dog was _brown_.
- The dog was _chestnut brown_.

### Adverb phrase

The adverb phrase is a unit that has an adverb at its head:
- The _absolutely_ crazy dog barked.

This adverb phrase is also part of the adjective phrase, _absolutely crazy_, which is part of a larger noun phrase, _The absolutely crazy dog_.

Remember that adverbs can modify both verbs and other adverbs:
- The dog barked _unbelievably loudly_.

### Prepositional phrase

Prepositional phrases almost always pair a preposition with an object, and the object is a noun phrase:
- A man _of means_.
- The cat is _in the hat_.
- The sad thing _about Jack_.
- Give it _to me_, now!
- _What_ are you talking _about_? (reworded: _About what_ are you talking?)

A preposition isn't always immediately before its object, so focus on function, not location.

## Clauses

A clause is a unit that has a subject and a verb:

- Rick cried.

### Coordinate clause

When two or more clauses of equal grammatical status that can stand alone as sentences are connected with a coordinating conjunction, such as:
- and
- but
- or
- so
- yet
- for
- nor

### Subordinate clause

When clauses are connected with a subordinating conjunction. There is a main/independant clause that can stand on its own as a sentence and a subordinate/dependent clause that cannot:

_Rick cried_ (main clause)

[after he watched a movie]. (subordinate clause)

Examples of subordinating conjunctions:
- after
- than
- if
- when

## Clauses and sentences

The number of clauses in a sentence and how they relate to each other determine whether the sentence is simple, compound, or complex.

### Five basic sentence structures

| Structure | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _subject_ + _verb_ | Sara smiled. | The verb is intransitive, which means that it does not take an object. |
| _subject_ + _verb_ + _direct object_ | Jane sang songs. | The verb is transitive, so it needs an object. The object is a noun phrase that receives the action of the verb--it is acted upon by the verb. |
| _subject_ + _verb_ + _indirect object_ + _direct object_ | Jane sang John a love song. | An _indirect object_ is a prepositional phrase with the preposition removed, and the remainder moved directly preceding the direct object. You can rewrite the example sentence as "Jane sang a love song _to John_". The omitted prepositional phrase is commonly _to_ or _for_.|
| _subject_ + _verb_ + _subject predicative_ | Sara is fancy. | A subject predicative, also known as a subject complement, is a grammatical component that follows a linking/copular verb that appears in the predicate and provides additional information about the subject of the sentence. The subject predicative does not receive the action of the verb, it is commonly an adjective phrase or a noun phrase. Main copular verbs are _be_, verbs of seeming, becoming, and the seven senses. |
| _subject_ + _verb_ + _direct object_ + _object predicative_ | Jan found the movie boring. | The predicate describes the action or state of the subject, but the object predicative--also called the object complement--describes or modifies the object of the verb, not the subject of the verb. |

### Simple sentence

A simple sentence has one clause, with or without other elements:

- Rick cried
- Rick cried about the game.
- Rick cried to Sally about the game yesterday.

### Compound sentence

A compound sentence has more than one clause that is linked with a coordinating conjunction. Each clause is of equal grammatical status, and is an independent clause:

_We sang songs_ and _we danced_.

### Complex sentence

A complex sentence has two or more clauses that are not of equal grammatical status. The clauses are unequal when one can stand alone as a sentence, but another clause cannot. They mix one or more independent clauses with one or more dependent clauses. These unequal clauses are joined by a subordinating conjunction such as:
- since
- when
- as
- if
- because

[Because you paid for tickets to the game], _I'll buy the beer_.


### Imperative sentences

Imperatives are commands that imply the subject, which is always _you_:
- Go. (_You_ go.)
- Stop. (_You_ stop.)

### Adverbials

Optional items consisting of words (commonly adverbs), phrases (commonly prepositional phrases), or clauses that you can remove from the sentence without harming its core structure or changing its grammatical status. 
- The band played a concert _in Panama_.
- David ate his lunch _at the table_.
- Barney reads books _slowly_.
- I saw Jane _yesterday_. (_yesterday_ is an adverb)

> Adverbials are optional and distinct from the main clause. They are not _adjunct adverbs_, adverbs that modify actions. Adjunct adverbs are part of phrases that make up the clause and refer directly to a word or phrase:
> - When the speaker began, John _quickly_ stopped talking and _closely_ listened. (adjunct adverbs)
> - John stopped talking _at some point today_. (adverbial)
