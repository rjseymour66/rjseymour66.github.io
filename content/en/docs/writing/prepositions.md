It is hard to define a preposition. A preposition is a headword in a prepositional phrase, which often includes an object--a noun phrase:
- Somewhere _over [the rainbow]_.
- Take me _to [the river]_.
- This is _between [those guys]_.

Prepositions are often interchangeable:
- I was bored _by_ her speech. | I was bored _with_ her speech.
