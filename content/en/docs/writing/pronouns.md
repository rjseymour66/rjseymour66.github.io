## Nouns vs Pronouns

Pronouns have different forms when they are working as the subject (nominative), object (objective), or possessor (genitive) case:
- subject: he
- object: him
- possessive: his

Pronouns do not take determiners:
- the
- a
- an

Pronouns do not take demontratives:
- those
- that
- these

## Categories

| Type | Examples |
|---|---|
| Personal | I, you, he, she, etc. and other cases and forms like me, my, and mine |
| Relative | that, which, who/whom, whoever/whomever |
| Reflexive | myself, yourself, himself, etc |
| Indefinite | anyone, somebody, one, all, any, etc. |
| Interrogative | who, which, what, where, how |
| Demonstrative | this, that, these, etc. |
| Reciprocal | each other, one another |
| Conditional | whatever, whichever, wherever, whoever, whomever |

## Noun phrase

A pronoun can be a noun phrase:
- _This_ is cool.
- _That_ is hers.
- _Ours_ is a long ride.
- Leave _mine_ alone.

## As determiners

A determiner is a word that introduces a noun and provides context about its reference in terms of definiteness, quantity, possession, or other aspects:
- the
- a
- an

Pronouns can function as determiners, where they refer to nouns:
- _This_ movie is long.
- This is _her_ book.

## Personal pronouns

Here are the subject and object forms of common personal pronouns:

| Subject | Object | Possessive deteminer | Possessive | Reflexive |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| I | me | my | mine | myself |
| you | you | your | yours | yourself, yourselves |
| he | him | his | his | himself |
| she | her | her | hers | herself |
| we | us | our | ours | ourselves |
| they | them | their | theirs | themselves |
| it | it | its | its | itself |

Possesive deteminers cannot function as noun phrases--they introduce nouns:
- That is _my_ car.
- _His_ dog is the smartest.

Possessive pronouns can function as a noun phrase:
- That is _his_.
- _Hers_ is the smartest.

### Nominative

Nominative pronouns function as subjects. They are noun phrases that perform the action of a verb:
- _I_ ate the pizza.
- _He_ is older than he looks.
- _We_ slept through the alarm.
- _They_ ran the red light.

#### Predicate nominative

The nominative (subject) pronoun form is referred to in the predicate of the sentence:
- The winner is _he_.

A predicate nominative (also called a predicate noun) is a noun or pronoun that follows a linking verb and renames, identifies, or provides additional information about the subject of the sentence. The linking verb connects the subject to the predicate nominative, making them equivalent in meaning. Predicate nominatives help to clarify or describe the subject further.

Key Characteristics:
- **Follows a Linking Verb**: A linking verb (such as "is," "are," "was," "were," "be," "become," "seem") connects the subject with the predicate nominative.
- **Renames or Identifies the Subject**: The predicate nominative provides another name or identity for the subject.
- **Equivalence**: The subject and the predicate nominative refer to the same person or thing.

### Objective

Objective pronouns act as the direct or indirect object of a transitive verb or the object of a perposition:
- Sara wrote _him_. (direct object)
- Jack talked to _her_. (object of preposition)
- Rex read him the riot act. (indirect object)
- That is between you and _me_. (object of preposition)

## It

Sometimes there is no noun functioning as an antecedent of 'it'. _It_ is called a number of things:
- prop it: Also called the 'empty it', when a phrase needs a subject, even though the subject is meaningless. For example:
  
  _It_ is cold outside.

  The verb phrase "is cold outside" contains all the information that we need, but it cannot stand alone and needs a subject.
- cleft it: Mainly for emphasis in a cleft sentence. A cleft sentence doesn't have a strong main clause. Instead, it uses a copular verb like _is_, then a relative pronoun before the verb:
  
  The thought counts.
  _It_ is the thought that counts. (_It is_ _noun phrase_ _relative pronoun_ _verb phrase_.)

  You can turn a regular sentence into a cleft sentence with _it_ and a copular/linking verb:

  Steve stole my hat. (_Steve stole_ is the main clause)
  _It was_ Steve that stole my hat. (_It was_ is the main clause, and _that_ precedes the verb _stole_).
- anticipatory it: Combines _it_ and a form of the verb _be_ as the main clause. It generally uses the following format:
  
  _It is_ _description_ _clause-being-described_. For example, you can structure the sentence this way:

  That you don't understand is embarrassing.

  And the same sentence as an anticipatory it:

  _It is_ embarrassing (that) you don't understand. (With an implied relative pronoun 'that')
 
 ## Existential _There_

 There is usually an adverb, but it can be a pronoun:

 _There_ are dogs in the house.
 
 This is the same as _Dogs are in the house_, but _there_ provides an entire phrase explaining that dogs exist ("There are dogs"). After the existenial phrase, you put a verb followed by the noun phrase that would have been the grammatical subject:

 _Cats are_ in the hat. (_Cats_ is the subject of the verb.)
 
 _There are_ cats in the hat. (_There_ is the existential subject of the verb.)

 ## Reflexive pronouns

 Pronouns that refer back to the subject or add emphasis, and they end in _self_ or _selves_:
 - my self
 - yourself
 - himself
 - herself
 - ourselves
 - themselves
 - itself
 - oneself

Adding emphasis:
- The promotion reflected on Ricky himself.
- I'm moving the piano myself.

Refer back to the subject. The subject of the sentence is also the object of either a verb or preposition:
- I can walk myself home.
- Steve gave himself a raise.

## Indefinite pronouns

These pronouns stand in for unspecified people or things and function as a noun phrase:
- anybody
- anyone
- everybody
- everyone
- everything
- somebody
- someone
- something
- anything
- all
- another
- each
- few
- many
- none
- one
- several
- enough

Can work as determiner (qualifier of adjectives) that precedes nouns and adds info about things like proximity, quantity, and definiteness:

Example:
- Enough is enough. (_enough_ is the noun phrase)
- Enough people voted for him. (Enough is a determiner of the noun _people_)
- You can't do it all. (_all_ is a noun phrase)
- All students need support. (_All_ is a determiner of _students_)

### "of the" phrases

In the following phrases, the pronouns are part of a noun phrase that is modified by a prepositional phrase:
- All of the dogs were barking.
- Some of the men helped us.

In the following phrases, the pronouns act as determiners:
- All dogs were barking.
- Some men helped us.

### Quantifiers

Indefinite pronouns address the number or quantity of things:
- There's _some_ pie on the counter.
- We couldn't find _any_ beer.
- _Many_ people think the world is round.

Pronouns that end in _-body_ or _-one_ refer to people:
- Can anyone hear me?
- Anybody will do.

Pronouns that end in _-thing_ cannot refer to people:
- Don't you know _anything_?
- _Something_ is better than nothing.

### Assertives vs non-assertives

Assertive pronouns indicate that at least one or some of the thing being referenced is represented by the pronoun:
- I'll have _some_ pie.
- There's _something_ in the corner.

Non-assertive pronouns indicate that there is none or maybe none of the thing:
- _None_ is happy with the outcome.
- _Anything_ can happen. (doesn't confirm that something will happen)

## Generic pronouns

Some pronouns refer to unspecified people:
- you - It doesn't matter what you do.
- we - We can't win all the time.
- they - They say its a losing game.
- one - One cannot live on ice cream alone.

_One_ can also function as the substitute one, where it stands in for a noun phrase that's already understood by the speaker and the listener:
- My brother doesn't have a birth mark, but I have one and my sister has one.

## Relative pronouns

Relative pronouns introduce relative clauses. Relative clauses postmodify nouns--they come after nouns and add some sort of description to them. This means that relative pronouns function adjectively:
- that
- which
- who/hom

And sometimes:
- where
- when

There are two types of relative clauses: restrictive and nonrestrictive. Restrictive clauses add information about the noun that you cannot remove, while nonrestrictive can be removed without changing the meaning of the sentence:

Examples:
- The dog _that was barking_ was brown. (restrictive)
- The lie, _which was mean_, really hurt her reputation. (nonrestrictive)
- The teacher, _who is great_, is the reason I succeeded. (nonrestrictive)
- The lady, _whom was in the car_, was wearing sunglasses. (restrictive)

Relative pronouns can also be the subject of the clause:
- The person _that yelled_ was annoying.
- The team _that wins_ goes to the championship.

### Zero relatives

A _zero relative_ pronoun is where you can drop the pronoun from a restrictive clause:
- The food _that_ we ate was delicious.
- The food we ate was delicious.

## Nominal relative

This pronoun introduces a whole clause that functions as a noun phrase:
- what
- whatever
- whatsoever
- which
- whichever
- whichsoever
- who
- whoever
- whosoever
- whom
- whomever
- whomsoever

Examples:

- _Whatever_ works for you, works for me.
- I don't know _what to think_.
- We couldn't tell _who was singing_ harmony.

They can also act as a determiner:
- I'll sing _whatever_ song you want me to sing.

## Conditional pronouns

These pronouns offer a range of choices and usually head up clauses:
- whatever
- whichever
- whoever (subject pronoun like _who_)
- whomever (object pronoun like _whom_)

Examples:
- I'll say _whatever_ you want.

## Demonstrative pronouns

These pronouns stand in for a noun phrase. They point toward the specific thing that you're talking about:
- this
- that
- these
- those

Example:
- I like _these_.

They can also function as determiners:
- I hate _that_ movie. (determiner)
- I hate _that_. (demonstrative)

## Reciprocal pronouns

These pronouns show you that two or more people did the same thing or had the same experience. There are two:
- each other
- one another

They are an efficient way of stating something once:
- Jack and Jill have fun with each other. = Jack has fun with Jill. Jill has fun with Jack.
- Tom and Jerry always fight with one another. = Tom always fights with Jerry. Jerry always fights with Tom.
