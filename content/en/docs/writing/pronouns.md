## Nouns vs Pronouns

Pronouns have different forms when they are working as the subject (nominative), object (objective), or possessor (genitive) case:
- subject: he
- object: him
- possessive: his

Pronouns do not take determiners:
- the
- a
- an

Pronouns do not take demontratives:
- those
- that
- these

## Categories

| Type | Examples |
|---|---|
| Personal | I, you, he, she, etc. and other cases and forms like me, my, and mine |
| Relative | that, which, who/whom, whoever/whomever |
| Reflexive | myself, yourself, himself, etc |
| Indefinite | anyone, somebody, one, all, any, etc. |
| Interrogative | who, which, what, where, how |
| Demonstrative | this, that, these, etc. |
| Reciprocal | each other, one another |
| Conditional | whatever, whichever, wherever, whoever, whomever |

## Noun phrase

A pronoun can be a noun phrase:
- _This_ is cool.
- _That_ is hers.
- _Ours_ is a long ride.
- Leave _mine_ alone.

## As determiners

A determiner is a word that introduces a noun and provides context about its reference in terms of definiteness, quantity, possession, or other aspects:
- the
- a
- an

Pronouns can function as determiners, where they refer to nouns:
- _This_ movie is long.
- This is _her_ book.

## Personal pronouns

Here are the subject and object forms of common personal pronouns:

| Subject | Object | Possessive deteminer | Possessive | Reflexive |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| I | me | my | mine | myself |
| you | you | your | yours | yourself, yourselves |
| he | him | his | his | himself |
| she | her | her | hers | herself |
| we | us | our | ours | ourselves |
| they | them | their | theirs | themselves |
| it | it | its | its | itself |

Possesive deteminers cannot function as noun phrases--they introduce nouns:
- That is _my_ car.
- _His_ dog is the smartest.

Possessive pronouns can function as a noun phrase:
- That is _his_.
- _Hers_ is the smartest.

### Nominative

Nominative pronouns function as subjects. They are noun phrases that perform the action of a verb:
- _I_ ate the pizza.
- _He_ is older than he looks.
- _We_ slept through the alarm.
- _They_ ran the red light.

#### Predicate nominative

The nominative (subject) pronoun form is referred to in the predicate of the sentence:
- The winner is _he_.

A predicate nominative (also called a predicate noun) is a noun or pronoun that follows a linking verb and renames, identifies, or provides additional information about the subject of the sentence. The linking verb connects the subject to the predicate nominative, making them equivalent in meaning. Predicate nominatives help to clarify or describe the subject further.

Key Characteristics:
- **Follows a Linking Verb**: A linking verb (such as "is," "are," "was," "were," "be," "become," "seem") connects the subject with the predicate nominative.
- **Renames or Identifies the Subject**: The predicate nominative provides another name or identity for the subject.
- **Equivalence**: The subject and the predicate nominative refer to the same person or thing.

### Objective

Objective pronouns act as the direct or indirect object of a transitive verb or the object of a perposition:
- Sara wrote _him_. (direct object)
- Jack talked to _her_. (object of preposition)
- Rex read him the riot act. (indirect object)
- That is between you and _me_. (object of preposition)
