  - verbs of seeming
  - verbs of becoming
  - the seven senses.

determiner
: a word that introduces a noun and provides information about its reference in terms of definiteness, quantity, possession, or other aspects. Determiners help clarify which noun is being referred to and specify details about the noun. They precede nouns and are essential in forming clear and specific noun phrases.

direct object
: Takes or accepts the action of a transitive verb.

  John makes _pies_.

ditransitive verb
: A verb that takes a direct object and indirect object.

independent clause
: Contain a subject and a conjugated verb that form the core of the sentence.

indirect object
: A prepositional phrase with the preposition removed, and the remainder moved directly preceding the direct object.

  You can rewrite the sentence "Jane sang _John_ a love song" as "Jane sang a love song _to John_". The omitted prepositional phrase is commonly _to_ or _for_.

intransitive verb
: A verb that does not take a direct object.
  
  Sara _smiled_.

monotransitive verb
: A verb that takes only the direct object.

noun

  - I thought the concert was _exciting_.
  - Stan makes _guitars_.

participle
: A form of a verb that is used to create verb tenses, adjectives, or to form a part of verb phrases. In English, there are two types of participles: present participles and past participles.
  
  - Present: add _-ing_
  - Past: add _-ed_

predicate
: Tells what the subject does or is. It includes the main verb and any objects, complements, or modifiers related to the action or state.

preposition
: Shows or describes spatial relationships. They shows the relationship between a noun or pronoun (the object of the preposition) and other words in a sentence. Prepositions often indicate relationships involving time, place, direction, cause, manner, and possession.

subject predicative
: Also known as a subject complement, is a grammatical component that follows a linking/copular verb that appears in the predicate and provides additional information about the subject of the sentence.

  The subject predicative does not receive the action of the verb, it is commonly an adjective phrase or a noun phrase.

  - Rick is _a fisherman_.
  - Steve is _the cleanup batter_.
  - Betty is _very nice_.

transitive verb
: A verb that needs a direct object. The direct object is a noun phrase that receives the action of the verb. In other words, it is acted upon by the verb.

verb
