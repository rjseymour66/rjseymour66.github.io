Verbs convey action or a state of being.

## Verb forms

Regardless of the verb's inflection, all verbs have a form-type:

| Form | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Base form | The infinitive form, does not require 'to' | walk |
| -s form | Third-person singular | walks |
| -ing (progressive) participle | Used in progressive verb tenses. | walking |
| Past form (-ed) | | he walked |
| Past participle (-ed) | Goes with some form of 'have' | he has walked |


## Tense

Tense refers to when the action expressed by the verb occurred:

| Tense | Example |
|---|---|
| Simple present | Steve jumps. |
| Simple past | Steve jumped. |
| Present perfect | Steve has jumped. |
| Past perfect | Steve had jumped. |
| Present progressive | Steve is jumping. |
| Past progressive | Steve was jumping. |
| Future | Steve will jump. |
| Future perfect | Steve will have jumped. |
| Modal perfect | Steve would have jumped. |

Verbs that express tense are finite, a verb that does not is inifinte:

- Finite: I did my homework.
- Infinite: I have homework.

## Aspect

How an action extends over time. There are two aspects:

Perfect
: Action completed by a certai point in time, even if that means that it will be completed in the future.
  auxillary verb: have

  - Dan has danced.
  - Dan had danced.
  - Dan will have danced.

Progressive
: Action ongoing for a period of time, even if the action occurred in the past or hasn't occurred yet.
  auxillary verb: be

  - Sally is running.
  - Sally was running.
  - Sally will be running in college.

  _Progressive participles_ are when you us an _-ing_ form of a verb with a form of _be_ to express ongoing action.

## Transitive, intransitive, and copular/linking verbs

### Transitive verb

Takes a direct object. The direct object is the recipient of the verb's action:

  Jack _kissed_ [Jill]. (Jill is the direct object)

### Intransitive verb
Does not take a direct object:

ack _cried_. (No direct object)

### Copular/linking verb

Neither transitive or intransitive. Most common is _be_, but includes other verbs that deal with being, becoming, appearing, and the five senses.

These verbs link the subject of the clause to a noun or adjective phrase in the predicate. So, the predicate refers back to the subject:

A Camaro _is_ [a sports car]. (noun phrase)
A Camaro _is_ [cool]. (adjective phrase)

The noun phrase that follows a copular verb is called a subject predicative, which is a different way to say that the subject is also referenced in the predicate.

Examples that don't use _be_ as the linking verb:
- Rachel became the new director.
- The movie looks bad.
- Doug acts impulsively.

#### Physical senses

Adverbs describe verbs/actions (quickly, badly, etc.), while adjectives describe nouns. For example:

- I feel bad. (correct: adjective describing the noun _bad_)
- I feel badly. (incorrect: adverb describing the verb _feel_. Essentially says "I cannot feel things well.")

## Auxillary and modal auxillary verbs

Auxillary verbs are helpers to lexical verbs (verbs that are not auxillary). The main aux verbs are _be_ and _have_. These verbs help express the following:
- When an action took place: _John has left_.
- Whether an action is ongoing: _Jim is talking_. _You are leaving_.

Modals do not have any form types (no _-s_, _-ing_ forms). Also, they cannot be inifinitives.
### Modal auxillary 

Express the following:
- certainty
- possibility
- willingness: 
- obligation: You should leave.
- necessity: You must leave.
- ability: You can cook.

These verbs include the following:
- can
- could
- may
- might
- will
- shall
- would
- should
- must

Semi-modal verbs (also called modal phrases):
- dare
- need
- outght to
- have to
- have got to
- to be going
- to be able to

#### Examples

- Ability: _Rick can swim_.
- Permission: _You may go to the restroom._
- Obligation: _You must go to the front door._

## Operators and dummy operators



Operators are verbs that move around to accomplish expression. Auxillary verbs _have_ and _be_ are often operators:
- _Have you_ eaten dinner?
- _Are you_ OK?

You can do the following:
- form a question: You swap the places of the subject and first auxiliary verb to make the verb an operator:
  
  Rick was crying. -> Was Rick crying?
- make the verb negative. You put _not_ after the auxiliary verb:
  
  It is cold outside -> It is not cold outside.
- add emphasis: Do leave your coat at the check.
- truncate sentences: I do.

### Dummy operator

Insert the dummy operator so you can have an operator that allows you to form a quesiton or add negation, particularly when there is no auxiliary verb to make a question or negation. Dummy operators include conjugations of the word _do_:
- do
- did
- does

Examples:
- Gary danced. -> Does Gary dance?
- Evelyn lies. -> Does Evelyn lies?

## Mood

There are three moods in English:

### Subjunctive

Expresses wishes, doubts, suggestions, hypothetical situations, or actions that have not yet occurred. The subjunctive mood conveys uncertainty, possibility, necessity, or emotion. It applies in the following:
  - contrary-to-fact situations: If I _were_ you...
  - commands
  - demands
  - statements of necessity
  - suggestions
  - requests
  - proposals
  - suppositions

Examples:
- I wish he were here.
- If you were here.
- It's important that you be quiet.

#### Present tense

You can apply to any verb, just replace the conjugated form with the base form:
- Rick _is_ here -> It is important that Rick _be_ here.
- I _am_ nice. -> It is critical that I _be_ nice.

#### Past tense

Applies only to _be_ and you just change any instance to _was_ or _were_:

- I was. -> I wish I were.
- He was. -> I wish he were.
- 

### Indicative

Any simple declarative statment of fact:
- He is there.
- John ran the race. 

### Imperative

A command where the subject is always an implied _You_.
- Do your homework
- Be ready.

The implied _you_ allows them to be one word long:
  - Eat!
  - Run!

## Voice

There are no active or passive verbs--whether a sentence is active or passive voice depends on the structure of the sentence. In passive construction, the object of the transitive verb is the grammatical subject of the sentence:
- Vicki ate the cake. (active)
- The cake was eaten by Vicki. (passive)

### Passive

Use passive when the object of the action is more important than the doer:
- Fido was found after a few days.

In the preceding sentence, we use passive to focus on Fido, rather than the person that found Fido.

To form a passive, you must combine the verb _be_ with the passive participle, which is the same as the past participle:
- God created the Earth. (active)
- The Earth _was_ created by God. (passive)

You do not have to include the doer of the action in the passive tense:
- The door was slammed by Bill.
- The door was slammed.

## Phrasal verbs

When a verb is used with one or more prepositions or adverbs to change the meaning of the verb, it is a phrasal verb. You can even insert a pronoun in the middle of the phrase:
- I _broke up with_ my boyfriend.
- Jill _made up_ her biography.
- We _put him up_ for the night. (Includes a pronoun)

## Gerunds

A gerund is the _-ing_ form of the verb used as a noun:
- _Crying_ is so sad.
- _Chewing the fat_ is my favorite pasttime.
- My nephews do not like _reading_.

## Participial modifiers (verbs as adjectives)

When you modify a noun with the participle form (_-ing_ or _-ed_ for regular verbs) of a verb:
- The _dancing_ fool.
- A _known_ fact.
- My favorite _writing_ class.

## Contraction

Commonly contracted verbs:
- be
- have
- will
- would
- not (adverb)
- us (pronoun)
